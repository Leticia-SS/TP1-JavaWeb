# TP1 - Unit Testing with JUnit  

This repository contains a Java unit testing exercise focused on verifying the correctness of the `ScientificCalculator` class using JUnit 5. The goal is to implement comprehensive test cases covering basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) and advanced scientific functions (exponents, square roots, logarithms, trigonometry).  

The exercise guides you through configuring JUnit 5, writing structured tests with proper phases (setup, execution, assertion), handling edge cases and exceptions, and improving test organization. Key tasks include validating both successful operations and error scenarios (like division by zero or invalid inputs), using test fixtures, and analyzing code coverage.  

Final deliverables include the complete test suite and a PDF report documenting the implementation.
